### **Introduction to Statistical Inference**

#### **Definition and Importance**

Statistical inference is a fundamental concept in statistics that allows us to make decisions or predictions about a population based on data collected from a sample. Since we rarely have access to complete population data, statistical inference helps us make reasonable assumptions about the population by analyzing sample data.

#### **What is Statistical Inference?**

Statistical inference refers to the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution of a population. The main goal is to draw conclusions about the population from a limited amount of data (a sample), allowing us to:
- Estimate population parameters (e.g., mean, proportion)
- Test hypotheses about the population
- Make predictions or decisions based on data

It involves two main types of procedures:
1. **Estimation**: Making an educated guess about population parameters based on sample data.
2. **Hypothesis Testing**: Testing a claim or assumption about a population using sample data.

##### **Example:**
Imagine you want to know the average height of all students in a university, but measuring every student is impractical. Instead, you take a sample of 100 students and use statistical inference to estimate the average height of all students at the university.

#### **Why Do We Need Statistical Inference in Data Analysis?**

1. **Impractical to Measure the Entire Population**: In most real-world scenarios, it's impossible or impractical to gather data from the entire population. For example, collecting data on every single person in a country or testing every product in a factory is usually too costly or time-consuming.
   
2. **Make Decisions Based on Limited Data**: Statistical inference allows us to make informed decisions even when we only have a subset of data. For instance, in medical research, we can infer the effectiveness of a new drug by testing it on a small sample of patients rather than the entire population.

3. **Understand the Uncertainty**: Statistical inference gives us tools (like confidence intervals and p-values) to quantify the uncertainty in our estimates and decisions. It helps us understand how confident we can be about the conclusions we draw from the sample data.

4. **Testing Hypotheses**: In science and business, it is often important to test hypotheses. For example, a company might want to know whether a new marketing strategy increases sales. Hypothesis testing enables us to analyze whether the observed effects in the sample are due to the strategy or just by chance.

5. **Generalization**: The core of statistical inference lies in its ability to generalize the findings from the sample to the entire population. It provides the mathematical framework to extend results beyond the data at hand.

---

In summary, **statistical inference** is essential because it allows us to make predictions, test hypotheses, and estimate unknown population parameters with limited data. It provides a rigorous framework for decision-making under uncertainty, which is vital in fields like business, healthcare, engineering, and scientific research.

--- 

### **Key Terms to Know:**
- **Population**: The entire group of individuals or items that we want to study.
- **Sample**: A subset of the population selected for analysis.
- **Parameter**: A numerical characteristic of the population (e.g., population mean).
- **Statistic**: A numerical characteristic of the sample (e.g., sample mean).

By mastering the concepts of statistical inference, you’ll be able to make data-driven decisions with confidence, even when working with limited information.

### **Point Estimation and Properties**

#### **Point Estimation**

##### **Definition of a Point Estimator**
A **point estimator** is a statistic used to estimate an unknown parameter of a population based on sample data. The idea is to provide a single best guess (or point estimate) for the population parameter. This point estimate is derived from the sample, and it can vary from sample to sample.

- **Example**: If you want to estimate the population mean, you can use the sample mean as the point estimate.

##### **Common Estimators**

1. **Mean**:  
   The sample mean ($\bar{x}$) is often used to estimate the population mean ($\mu$). It is calculated by summing all the observations in the sample and dividing by the sample size:
   $$
   \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
   $$
   where $x_i$ represents each observation in the sample and $n$ is the sample size.

2. **Variance**:  
   The sample variance ($s^2$) is used to estimate the population variance ($\sigma^2$). The formula for sample variance is:
   $$
   s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2
   $$
   Here, we divide by $n-1$ (instead of $n$) to account for the loss of a degree of freedom in estimating the mean.

---

#### **Properties of Estimators**

##### **1. Bias**
Bias measures the difference between the expected value of the estimator and the true population parameter. An estimator is **unbiased** if its expected value equals the population parameter.

- **Unbiased Estimator**: An estimator $\hat{\theta}$ is unbiased if:
  $$
  E(\hat{\theta}) = \theta
  $$
  where $\theta$ is the true population parameter.

- **Biased Estimator**: If $E(\hat{\theta}) \neq \theta$, the estimator is biased.

**Examples**:
- The sample mean ($\bar{x}$) is an unbiased estimator of the population mean ($\mu$).
- The sample variance ($s^2$) is an unbiased estimator of the population variance ($\sigma^2$).

**Intuitive Example**:
If you flip a biased coin and try to estimate the probability of heads, your estimator might consistently overestimate or underestimate the true probability, making it biased.

##### **2. Consistency**
An estimator is **consistent** if, as the sample size increases, the estimator gets closer to the true population parameter. Formally, $\hat{\theta}$ is consistent if:
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} P(|\hat{\theta}_n - \theta| < \epsilon) = 1
$$
This means that as the sample size grows, the probability that the estimator will be close to the true parameter approaches 1.

**Example**:
The sample mean ($\bar{x}$) is a consistent estimator of the population mean ($\mu$). As we take larger samples, the sample mean gets closer to the true mean.

##### **3. Efficiency**
An estimator is **efficient** if it has the smallest possible variance among all unbiased estimators of the same parameter. A more efficient estimator will have tighter estimates with less variability.

- The efficiency of an estimator is often compared using the **Cramer-Rao Lower Bound** (CRLB), which provides a theoretical minimum for the variance of an unbiased estimator.
  
**Example**:
If two unbiased estimators are available for the same parameter, the one with the smaller variance is more efficient.

---

### **Hands-On Example: Estimating the Population Mean and Discussing Bias**

Consider a scenario where you want to estimate the average height of all college students in a university. Measuring the entire population is impractical, so you decide to take a sample of 50 students.

1. **Sample Data**: Assume you collect a sample of heights in centimeters.
   - Heights (in cm): [160, 170, 165, 180, 175, 172, 168, 169, 171, 173, ..., etc.]

2. **Calculate the Sample Mean**: The point estimator for the population mean is the sample mean.
   $$
   \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
   $$

3. **Discuss Bias**: Suppose your sampling method tends to select more students from the sports department (who are generally taller). This might introduce **bias** into your estimate, as your sample may not represent the entire student population. Your estimator may consistently overestimate the true population mean.

     2. Is the sample variance you calculated an unbiased estimator of the population variance? Why or why not?

---

#### **5. Real-World Application**

a) **Identify a scenario where an unbiased but inefficient estimator might not be useful**.  
   - Choose a real-life example (e.g., estimating the average time taken by customers in a store), and explain why efficiency could be more important than just being unbiased.

---

### **Answer Key (For Reference)**

1. Conceptual Questions:  
   a) **Answer**: A point estimator is a statistic used to estimate a population parameter. Example: The sample mean is a point estimator of the population mean.  
   b) **Answer**: The sample mean estimates the population mean, and the sample variance estimates the population variance.

2. Understanding Bias, Consistency, and Efficiency:  
   a) **Answer**: False (An unbiased estimator does not necessarily have a smaller variance); True (A consistent estimator converges to the true value as sample size increases).  
   b) **Answer**: Bias occurs when the expected value of the estimator does not equal the true population parameter. Example of biased estimator: a coin-flip estimate that systematically overestimates heads. Example of unbiased estimator: the sample mean for estimating the population mean.

---

These exercises assess the students' grasp of point estimation concepts and help them apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.



### **Confidence Intervals**

#### **1. Definition**

##### **What is a Confidence Interval?**

A **confidence interval (CI)** is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter (such as the mean or proportion) with a certain level of confidence. It provides an estimate of uncertainty around the point estimate.

For example, if we calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean, we are 95% confident that the true population mean lies within the interval.

##### **Interpretation of Confidence Levels**

The **confidence level** (e.g., 90%, 95%, 99%) represents the probability that the interval contains the true population parameter in repeated sampling. 

- **95% Confidence Interval**: If we take many random samples and construct a 95% confidence interval from each sample, 95% of those intervals will contain the true population parameter.
- **Confidence level does not mean** that there is a 95% probability that any specific interval contains the true parameter. Instead, it reflects how often the intervals, if repeated many times, will capture the true value.

#### **2. Construction of Confidence Intervals**

##### **Using the Sample Mean and Standard Error**

To construct a confidence interval for the population mean ($\mu$) when the sample mean ($\bar{x}$) and the sample standard deviation ($s$) are known, we can use the following formula for a confidence interval:

$$
CI = \bar{x} \pm z \cdot \left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
$$

Where:
- $\bar{x}$ = Sample mean
- $z$ = Z-value corresponding to the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for a 95% confidence level)
- $s$ = Sample standard deviation
- $n$ = Sample size

The term $\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$ is called the **standard error** of the mean.

##### **Confidence Interval for Proportions**

For proportions, the formula for the confidence interval is slightly different. If you want to estimate a population proportion $p$ based on a sample proportion $\hat{p}$, the confidence interval is:

$$
CI = \hat{p} \pm z \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}
$$

Where:
- $\hat{p}$ = Sample proportion
- $z$ = Z-value corresponding to the confidence level
- $n$ = Sample size

#### **3. Interpretation of Confidence Intervals**

- **How to interpret**: Suppose we construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean of a sample, and the result is $[70, 80]$. This means we are 95% confident that the true population mean lies between 70 and 80. However, it **does not** mean that there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies within this specific interval.
  
- **The range reflects uncertainty**: Wider confidence intervals indicate more uncertainty in the estimate, while narrower intervals suggest greater precision.

#### **4. Hands-On Example**

##### **Constructing a Confidence Interval for the Sample Mean**

Imagine we collected data on the weights (in kilograms) of 50 people from a population. The sample data has the following summary statistics:
- Sample mean ($\bar{x}$) = 70 kg
- Sample standard deviation ($s$) = 5 kg
- Sample size ($n$) = 50

We want to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true population mean weight.

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Find the Z-value for 95% confidence**: For a 95% confidence level, the corresponding Z-value is 1.96.

2. **Calculate the Standard Error**:
   $$
   SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{50}} \approx 0.707
   $$

3. **Construct the Confidence Interval**:
   $$
   CI = 70 \pm 1.96 \cdot 0.707
   $$
   $$
   CI = 70 \pm 1.385
   $$
   $$
   CI = [68.615, 71.385]
   $$

Thus, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight is $[68.615, 71.385]$. We are 95% confident that the true mean weight of the population lies within this range.

   - Explain the interpretation of a 95% confidence level in your own words.

---

#### **2. Understanding Confidence Intervals**

a) **True or False**:
   1. A 95% confidence interval means there is a 95% chance that the true population parameter is within the calculated interval.
   2. If you increase the sample size, the confidence interval generally becomes narrower.

---

#### **3. Practical Exercise**

b) **Choosing a Confidence Level**:  
   - In practice, why might you choose a 90% confidence interval instead of a 95% confidence interval? What are the trade-offs?

---

### **Answer Key (For Reference)**

1. Conceptual Questions:  
   a) A confidence interval is a range of values, derived from a sample, that is likely to contain the true population parameter. It is used to quantify uncertainty in an estimate.  
   b) A 95% confidence level means that if we were to take many samples and construct a confidence interval from each, 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.

2. Understanding Confidence Intervals:

   1. False  
   2. True  
   3. True  
   
   b) **Answer**: Increasing the confidence level from 95% to 99% makes the interval wider, because a higher confidence level requires capturing more potential values of the population parameter, resulting in a broader range.

---

These exercises will help students understand the concept of confidence intervals and give them practical experience in constructing and interpreting intervals.




### **Hypothesis Testing**

#### **1. Introduction to Hypothesis Testing**

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. It allows us to evaluate two competing statements (hypotheses) about a population parameter.

##### **Null and Alternative Hypotheses (H₀ and H₁)**

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The null hypothesis is the statement that there is **no effect** or **no difference**. It is the hypothesis that we aim to test and possibly reject.  
  Example: "The average weight of apples is 150 grams."

- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The alternative hypothesis is the statement that there **is an effect** or **a difference**. It represents what we are trying to prove.  
  Example: "The average weight of apples is not 150 grams."

The goal of hypothesis testing is to determine whether there is enough evidence in the sample data to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

#### **2. Type I and Type II Errors**

In hypothesis testing, we can make two types of errors:

- **Type I Error (False Positive)**: This occurs when we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by $\alpha$, and it is called the **significance level** of the test (usually set at 0.05).

  - **Example**: If we conclude that a new drug is effective when it is not, we have made a Type I error.

- **Type II Error (False Negative)**: This occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. The probability of making a Type II error is denoted by $\beta$.

  - **Example**: If we fail to conclude that a new drug is effective when it actually is, we have made a Type II error.

##### **Real-World Significance of Errors**

- **Type I errors** could lead to false claims, such as approving an ineffective medication.
- **Type II errors** could result in missed opportunities, such as not recognizing the effectiveness of a beneficial treatment.

#### **3. p-values and Significance Levels**

##### **What is a p-value?**

A **p-value** is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. It quantifies the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis.

- A **small p-value** (e.g., less than 0.05) provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so we reject $H_0$.
- A **large p-value** (greater than or equal to 0.05) suggests weak evidence against $H_0$, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

##### **Interpreting p-values Against Significance Levels**

- **Significance level ($\alpha$)**: A threshold that defines the maximum probability of committing a Type I error. Common choices for $\alpha$ are 0.05, 0.01, or 0.10.
  - If $p \leq \alpha$, reject the null hypothesis ($H_0$).
  - If $p > \alpha$, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

For example, if $p = 0.03$ and $\alpha = 0.05$, we reject $H_0$ because 0.03 is less than 0.05, meaning the data provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

#### **4. Hands-On Example**

##### **Hypothesis Testing for a Population Mean**

Let's perform a simple hypothesis test to check whether the average height of students at a university is 170 cm.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The average height is 170 cm. ($H_0: \mu = 170$)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The average height is not 170 cm. ($H_1: \mu \neq 170$)

**Step-by-Step Example:**

1. **Collect Data**: We randomly sample 30 students, and the sample mean height is 172 cm with a standard deviation of 6 cm.
2. **Set the Significance Level**: We'll use a significance level of 0.05.
3. **Perform the Test**:
   - The formula for the test statistic is:
     $$
     t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}
     $$
     Where:
     - $\bar{x} = 172$ (sample mean)
     - $\mu_0 = 170$ (population mean under $H_0$)
     - $s = 6$ (sample standard deviation)
     - $n = 30$ (sample size)

     Plugging in the values:
     $$
     t = \frac{172 - 170}{\frac{6}{\sqrt{30}}} \approx 1.825
     $$

4. **Find the p-value**: Using statistical tables or software, we find the p-value for $t = 1.825$ and 29 degrees of freedom. Let's assume the p-value is 0.08.

5. **Make a Decision**: Since $p = 0.08 > 0.05$, we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to conclude that the average height of students is different from 170 cm.

#### **2. Understanding Type I and Type II Errors**

a) **Scenario**: A company claims that the average battery life of its new phone model is 10 hours. You want to test whether this claim is accurate.
   - **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The average battery life is 10 hours.
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The average battery life is not 10 hours.

  **Questions**:
   1. What would a Type I error be in this situation?
   2. What would a Type II error be?

#### **3. Hypothesis Test Example**

a) You collect a random sample of 50 students and measure their average math test score, which is 85, with a standard deviation of 10. The national average score is known to be 80. Perform a hypothesis test to check if the average math score of your sample is significantly different from the national average. Use a significance level of 0.05.

- **Step-by-Step**:
   1. State the null and alternative hypotheses.
   2. Calculate the test statistic.
   3. Find the p-value.
   4. Based on the p-value, make a decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

#### **4. Real-World Application**

a) **p-value Interpretation**:  
   A medical researcher claims that a new drug lowers blood pressure by an average of 10 mmHg. You perform a study and find that the p-value for the test is 0.02. If you are using a significance level of 0.05, what conclusion should you draw about the effectiveness of the drug? Explain your reasoning.

#### **5. Critical Thinking**

a) **Effect of Significance Level on Decision**:  
   How would the result of a hypothesis test change if you lower the significance level from 0.05 to 0.01? What is the trade-off of using a smaller significance level?

### **Answer Key (For Reference)**

1. **Conceptual Questions**:  
   a)  
      - Null hypothesis: A statement that there is no effect or difference.
      - Alternative hypothesis: A statement that there is an effect or difference.  
   b)  
      1. False  
      2. True  
      3. False  

2. **Type I and Type II Errors**:  
   - Type I error: Concluding that the average battery life is not 10 hours when it actually is.
   - Type II error: Failing to detect that the battery life is not 10 hours when it is different.

3. **Hypothesis Test Example**:  
   a)  
      1. Null hypothesis ($H_0$): The average score is 80.  
         Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$): The average score is not 80.  
      2. Test statistic:  
         $$
         t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{85 - 80}{\frac{10}{\sqrt{50}}} = 3.54
         $$
      3. p-value (for t = 3.54 and 49 degrees of freedom) ≈ 0.001.  
      4. Since $p = 0.001 < 0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis. The average math score is significantly different from the national average.

4. **Real-World Application**:  
   - Since $p = 0.02 < 0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis. There is strong evidence to suggest that the drug lowers blood pressure by




### **T-tests, Z-tests, Chi-Square Tests, and ANOVA**

---

#### **1. T-tests**

A **t-test** is used to compare means and determine if they are significantly different from each other. It is useful when:
- The sample size is small (typically $n < 30$).
- The population variance is unknown.

##### **Types of T-tests:**
1. **One-sample t-test**: Tests if the mean of a single group is significantly different from a known value.
2. **Two-sample t-test (Independent)**: Compares the means of two independent groups.
3. **Paired t-test**: Compares means from the same group at two different times (repeated measures).

##### **Example**: 
Testing if the average height of students in a class is 170 cm using a sample of 15 students.

---

#### **2. Z-tests**

A **Z-test** is similar to a t-test but used when:
- The sample size is large (typically $n \geq 30$).
- The population variance is known.

##### **Example**: 
Testing whether the average income of a group is different from the national average, using data from 100 people where the population variance is known.

---

#### **3. Chi-Square Tests**

The **Chi-Square test** is used to test relationships between categorical variables. There are two main types:
1. **Chi-square test for independence**: Determines if two categorical variables are related.
2. **Goodness-of-fit test**: Tests if observed data fits a specific distribution.

##### **Example**: 
Testing if the color preference (Red, Blue, Green) of people is independent of their gender.

---

#### **4. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**

**ANOVA** is used to compare the means of three or more groups to determine if at least one mean is different from the others.

##### **Example**: 
Testing whether the average exam scores differ across three different teaching methods.

---

### **5. Hands-On Example**

#### **One-sample t-test Example:**
We want to test if the average weight of apples in a farm is 150 grams. A random sample of 12 apples is collected, and the sample mean weight is 155 grams, with a sample standard deviation of 8 grams.

- Null hypothesis ($H_0$): The average weight is 150 grams.
- Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$): The average weight is not 150 grams.

The formula for the t-statistic is:
$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$
Where:
- $\bar{x} = 155$
- $\mu_0 = 150$
- $s = 8$
- $n = 12$

Plugging in the values:
$$
t = \frac{155 - 150}{\frac{8}{\sqrt{12}}} = 2.165
$$
Using a t-distribution table, we can find the p-value and compare it to the significance level to make a decision.

#### **Chi-Square Test Example:**

Suppose a store wants to test whether the preferences for four product colors (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) are equally distributed. The observed preferences from a sample of 200 customers are: Red (50), Blue (60), Green (40), Yellow (50).

The expected frequency for each color under the assumption of equal distribution is:
$$
\text{Expected frequency} = \frac{200}{4} = 50
$$

We compute the chi-square statistic as:
$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$
Where $O_i$ is the observed frequency and $E_i$ is the expected frequency.

For this case:
$$
\chi^2 = \frac{(50-50)^2}{50} + \frac{(60-50)^2}{50} + \frac{(40-50)^2}{50} + \frac{(50-50)^2}{50} = 4
$$

We can compare this value to the critical chi-square value to make a decision.

### **Assessment Solutions**

1. **T-test:**
   - Null hypothesis: $H_0$: The average score is 75.
   - Alternative hypothesis: $H_1$: The average score is not 75.
   - $t = \frac{78 - 75}{\frac{5}{\sqrt{20}}} = 2.683$
   - With 19 degrees of freedom, the p-value is approximately 0.014, so reject $H_0$.

2. **Z-test:**
   - Null hypothesis: $H_0$: The average lifespan is 1,200 hours.
   - Alternative hypothesis: $H_1$: The average lifespan is not 1,200 hours.
   - $Z = \frac{1180 - 1200}{\frac{40}{\sqrt{50}}} = -3.54$
   - Since $|Z| > 1.96$ (critical value), reject $H_0$.

3. **Chi-Square Test:**
   - Null hypothesis: The die is fair.
   - Alternative hypothesis: The die is not fair.
   - $\chi^2 = \frac{(8-10)^2}{10} + \frac{(10-10)^2}{10} + \frac{(9-10)^2}{10} + \frac{(12-10)^2}{10} + \frac{(11-10)^2}{10} + \frac{(10-10)^2}{10} = 1.6$
   - With 5 degrees of freedom, the critical value is 11.07. Since 1.6 < 11.07, fail to reject $H_0$.

4. **ANOVA:**
   - Null hypothesis: The mean weight loss for all groups is the same.
   - Alternative hypothesis: At least one group’s mean weight loss is different.
   - Perform ANOVA calculations to get an F-statistic and compare it with the critical value. If $F > F_{\alpha}$, reject $H_0$.




### **T-tests: A Detailed Tutorial**

---

#### **What is a T-test?**
A **t-test** is a type of statistical test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. It’s particularly useful when the sample size is small and the population variance is unknown. 

T-tests help answer questions such as:
- Is the average score of one group significantly different from a known population mean?
- Are the average scores of two different groups significantly different from each other?
- Did a group’s average score change after some intervention?

---

### **Types of T-tests**
There are three main types of t-tests, depending on the data structure and the hypothesis being tested.

#### **1. One-Sample T-test**
Used to compare the mean of a single sample to a known value (often a population mean).

- **Example**: You measure the heights of 10 students and want to know if the mean height is significantly different from a national average of 170 cm.

The formula for the one-sample t-test is:
$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$
Where:
- $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean.
- $\mu_0$ is the population mean (the value you are testing against).
- $s$ is the sample standard deviation.
- $n$ is the sample size.

#### **2. Two-Sample T-test (Independent T-test)**
Used to compare the means of two independent groups to see if they are significantly different from each other. The groups should be independent, meaning no relationship exists between the groups.

- **Example**: You want to compare the exam scores of two different classes to see if one class performed better than the other.

The formula for the two-sample t-test is:
$$
t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}
$$
Where:
- $\bar{x}_1$ and $\bar{x}_2$ are the sample means of the two groups.
- $s_1^2$ and $s_2^2$ are the variances of the two groups.
- $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sample sizes of the two groups.

#### **3. Paired T-test (Dependent T-test)**
Used when the samples are dependent, such as when you measure the same group of individuals twice (e.g., before and after an intervention).

- **Example**: You want to test whether a diet program is effective by measuring the weights of the same group of individuals before and after they follow the diet.

The formula for the paired t-test is:
$$
t = \frac{\bar{d}}{\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$
Where:
- $\bar{d}$ is the mean of the differences between paired observations.
- $s_d$ is the standard deviation of the differences.
- $n$ is the number of pairs.

---

### **Assumptions of T-tests**
For a t-test to be valid, certain assumptions should be met:
1. **Independence**: The observations within each group must be independent of each other.
2. **Normality**: The data should follow a normal distribution, especially for small sample sizes.
3. **Homogeneity of variance**: For two-sample t-tests, the variances of the two groups should be roughly equal.

---

### **Step-by-Step Guide to Performing a T-test**

#### **1. Define the Hypotheses**
Before performing any t-test, define your null and alternative hypotheses.

- **Null hypothesis ($H_0$)**: Assumes there is no significant difference between the means (e.g., the means are equal).
- **Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$)**: Assumes there is a significant difference between the means (e.g., the means are not equal).

#### **2. Select the Appropriate T-test**
- Use a **one-sample t-test** when comparing a single group’s mean to a known value.
- Use a **two-sample t-test** when comparing the means of two independent groups.
- Use a **paired t-test** when comparing means from the same group at two different times.

#### **3. Calculate the Test Statistic**
Using the appropriate formula (as shown above), calculate the t-statistic. The t-statistic measures the size of the difference relative to the variation in the sample data.

#### **4. Determine the Degrees of Freedom**
The degrees of freedom (df) depend on the type of t-test:
- **One-sample t-test**: $df = n - 1$
- **Two-sample t-test**: $df = n_1 + n_2 - 2$
- **Paired t-test**: $df = n - 1$

#### **5. Find the Critical Value or P-value**
Compare the t-statistic to the critical value from the t-distribution table at your chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05). Alternatively, calculate the p-value and compare it to your significance level:
- If the p-value is less than 0.05, reject the null hypothesis.
- If the p-value is greater than 0.05, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

### **Hands-On Example: One-Sample T-test**

Suppose you want to test if the average daily study time of students is significantly different from 3 hours. You take a random sample of 10 students, and their average daily study time is 3.5 hours with a standard deviation of 0.8 hours. You are testing at the 0.05 significance level.

1. **State the hypotheses:**
   - $H_0$: The average daily study time is 3 hours ($\mu = 3$).
   - $H_1$: The average daily study time is not 3 hours ($\mu \neq 3$).

2. **Calculate the t-statistic:**
   - Sample mean ($\bar{x}$) = 3.5
   - Population mean ($\mu_0$) = 3
   - Sample standard deviation ($s$) = 0.8
   - Sample size ($n$) = 10
   $$
   t = \frac{3.5 - 3}{\frac{0.8}{\sqrt{10}}} = \frac{0.5}{0.253} = 1.976
   $$

3. **Degrees of freedom:**
   - $df = n - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9$

4. **Compare the t-statistic to the critical value:**
   - From the t-distribution table, for $df = 9$ and a significance level of 0.05, the critical t-value for a two-tailed test is approximately 2.262.
   - Since the calculated $t$-value (1.976) is less than the critical t-value (2.262), we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis.

---

### **Interpreting Results**
For the one-sample t-test, our t-statistic (1.976) was less than the critical value, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means there is **not enough evidence** to say that the average daily study time is different from 3 hours.

---

### **Common Applications of T-tests**

1. **Medical Research**: Comparing the effectiveness of two drugs on patient recovery times.
2. **Education**: Testing whether a new teaching method results in better student performance compared to a traditional method.
3. **Marketing**: Evaluating whether two different advertising campaigns result in different levels of customer engagement.

### **Assessment Exercise: T-tests**

#### **1. One-Sample T-test Exercise:**
A fitness coach claims that participants in a new training program exercise an average of 60 minutes per day. A random sample of 8 participants shows a mean of 65 minutes, with a sample standard deviation of 5 minutes. Test at the 0.05 significance level whether the sample mean is significantly different from 60 minutes.

1. State the null and alternative hypotheses.
2. Calculate the t-statistic.
3. Find the degrees of freedom and critical t-value.
4. Make a decision: Should the null hypothesis be rejected?

#### **2. Two-Sample T-test Exercise:**
You want to compare the exam scores of two groups of students. Group A has 12 students with a mean score of 80 and a standard deviation of 10, and Group B has 10 students with a mean score of 85 and a standard deviation of 8. Test at the 0.05 significance level whether there is a significant difference between the two group means.

1. State the null and alternative hypotheses.
2. Calculate the t-statistic.
3. Find the degrees of freedom and critical t-value.
4. Make a decision: Should the null hypothesis be rejected?

---

### **Assessment Solutions**

#### **1. One-Sample T-test Solution:**
- Null hypothesis: $H_0$: The average exercise time is 60 minutes.
- Alternative hypothesis: $H_1$: The average exercise time is not 60 minutes.
- $t = \frac{65 - 60}{\frac{5}{\sqrt{8}}} = \frac{5}{1.77} = 2.82$
- Degrees of freedom: $df = 7$
- Critical value for $df

 = 7$ at the 0.05 significance level (two-tailed) is approximately 2.365.
- Since 2.82 > 2.365, **reject the null hypothesis**. There is evidence to suggest that the average exercise time is significantly different from 60 minutes.

#### **2. Two-Sample T-test Solution:**
- Null hypothesis: $H_0$: There is no significant difference between the two group means.
- Alternative hypothesis: $H_1$: There is a significant difference between the two group means.
- $t = \frac{80 - 85}{\sqrt{\frac{10^2}{12} + \frac{8^2}{10}}} = \frac{-5}{\sqrt{8.33 + 6.4}} = \frac{-5}{\sqrt{14.73}} = \frac{-5}{3.84} = -1.3$
- Degrees of freedom: $df = 12 + 10 - 2 = 20$
- Critical value for $df = 20$ at the 0.05 significance level (two-tailed) is approximately 2.086.
- Since $-1.3$ is less than 2.086, **fail to reject the null hypothesis**. There is no significant difference between the two group means.

This detailed explanation of t-tests, with hands-on examples and exercises, will help students understand when and how to use different types of t-tests in practice.





### **Z-tests: A Detailed Tutorial**

---

#### **What is a Z-test?**
A **Z-test** is a statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of a sample and a population or between the means of two samples. The Z-test is applicable when the population variance is known and the sample size is sufficiently large (typically $n \geq 30$). 

Z-tests are often used in hypothesis testing to make inferences about population parameters based on sample statistics.

---

### **Types of Z-tests**
There are three main types of Z-tests, depending on the scenario being analyzed:

#### **1. One-Sample Z-test**
Used to compare the sample mean to a known population mean when the population variance is known.

- **Example**: Suppose a factory claims that its light bulbs last on average 1,000 hours. A quality control manager tests a random sample of 50 bulbs and finds their average lifetime is 1,020 hours with a population variance of 400.

The formula for the one-sample Z-test is:
$$
Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
$$
Where:
- $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean.
- $\mu$ is the population mean (the value you are testing against).
- $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.
- $n$ is the sample size.

#### **2. Two-Sample Z-test**
Used to compare the means of two independent groups when the population variances are known.

- **Example**: You want to compare the average heights of two different breeds of dogs. Breed A has a mean height of 24 inches with a population variance of 16, while Breed B has a mean height of 22 inches with a population variance of 25.

The formula for the two-sample Z-test is:
$$
Z = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}}
$$
Where:
- $\bar{x}_1$ and $\bar{x}_2$ are the sample means of the two groups.
- $\sigma_1^2$ and $\sigma_2^2$ are the variances of the two groups.
- $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sample sizes of the two groups.

#### **3. Z-test for Proportions**
Used to compare sample proportions to a population proportion or to compare the proportions of two independent groups.

- **Example**: Suppose a survey indicates that 60% of adults prefer coffee over tea. You survey a sample of 100 adults and find that 70% prefer coffee. 

The formula for the Z-test for proportions is:
$$
Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}}}
$$
Where:
- $\hat{p}$ is the sample proportion.
- $p_0$ is the population proportion.
- $n$ is the sample size.

---

### **Assumptions of Z-tests**
For a Z-test to be valid, the following assumptions should be met:
1. **Independence**: The observations must be independent of each other.
2. **Normality**: The sampling distribution of the sample mean should be approximately normally distributed. This is typically satisfied if the sample size is large (n ≥ 30).
3. **Known Population Variance**: The population variance must be known for a one-sample Z-test or for both groups in a two-sample Z-test.

---

### **Step-by-Step Guide to Performing a Z-test**

#### **1. Define the Hypotheses**
Before performing any Z-test, define your null and alternative hypotheses.

- **Null hypothesis ($H_0$)**: Assumes there is no significant difference between the means or proportions (e.g., the means are equal).
- **Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$)**: Assumes there is a significant difference between the means or proportions (e.g., the means are not equal).

#### **2. Select the Appropriate Z-test**
- Use a **one-sample Z-test** when comparing a single sample’s mean to a known population mean.
- Use a **two-sample Z-test** when comparing the means of two independent groups.
- Use a **Z-test for proportions** when comparing a sample proportion to a known population proportion or comparing two sample proportions.

#### **3. Calculate the Test Statistic**
Using the appropriate formula (as shown above), calculate the Z-statistic. The Z-statistic measures the size of the difference relative to the variation in the sample data.

#### **4. Determine the Critical Value or P-value**
- Compare the Z-statistic to the critical value from the Z-distribution table at your chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05).
- Alternatively, calculate the p-value and compare it to your significance level:
  - If the p-value is less than 0.05, reject the null hypothesis.
  - If the p-value is greater than 0.05, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

#### **5. Make a Decision**
Based on the comparison of the Z-statistic and the critical value (or p-value), make a decision regarding the null hypothesis.

---

### **Hands-On Example: One-Sample Z-test**

Suppose a nutritionist claims that the average daily intake of sodium in the U.S. is 2,500 mg. A random sample of 40 adults shows an average sodium intake of 2,600 mg with a known population variance of 1,600 mg.

1. **State the hypotheses:**
   - $H_0$: The average sodium intake is 2,500 mg ($\mu = 2500$).
   - $H_1$: The average sodium intake is not 2,500 mg ($\mu \neq 2500$).

2. **Calculate the Z-statistic:**
   - Sample mean ($\bar{x}$) = 2,600 mg
   - Population mean ($\mu$) = 2,500 mg
   - Population variance ($\sigma^2$) = 1,600 mg
   - Sample size ($n$) = 40
   $$
   Z = \frac{2600 - 2500}{\sqrt{1600 / 40}} = \frac{100}{\sqrt{40}} = \frac{100}{6.32} \approx 15.81
   $$

3. **Find the critical value:**
   - For a significance level of 0.05 (two-tailed), the critical Z-values are approximately ±1.96.

4. **Make a decision:**
   - Since $Z \approx 15.81$ is greater than 1.96, we **reject the null hypothesis**. There is strong evidence to suggest that the average sodium intake is significantly different from 2,500 mg.

---

### **Common Applications of Z-tests**

1. **Quality Control**: Checking if the average product weight is within specified limits.
2. **Public Health**: Determining if the average number of daily steps taken by individuals is different from a recommended guideline.
3. **Marketing**: Evaluating if the proportion of customers who prefer a new product is different from the historical data.

### **Assessment Exercise: Z-tests**

#### **1. One-Sample Z-test Exercise:**
A company claims that its batteries last an average of 150 hours. A random sample of 36 batteries shows an average life of 155 hours with a population variance of 144 hours. Test at the 0.05 significance level whether the sample mean is significantly different from 150 hours.

1. State the null and alternative hypotheses.
2. Calculate the Z-statistic.
3. Find the critical Z-value and make a decision.

#### **2. Two-Sample Z-test Exercise:**
You want to compare the average income of two different regions. Region A has a sample mean income of $60,000 with a population variance of $16,000,000, while Region B has a sample mean income of $65,000 with a population variance of $25,000,000. Test at the 0.05 significance level whether there is a significant difference between the two region means.

1. State the null and alternative hypotheses.
2. Calculate the Z-statistic.
3. Find the critical Z-value and make a decision.

---

### **Assessment Solutions**

#### **1. One-Sample Z-test Solution:**
- Null hypothesis: $H_0$: The average battery life is 150 hours.
- Alternative hypothesis: $H_1$: The average battery life is not 150 hours.
- $Z = \frac{155 - 150}{\sqrt{144 / 36}} = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5$
- Critical Z-value for $ \alpha = 0.05$ (two-tailed) is approximately ±1.96.
- Since $2.5 > 1.96$, **reject the null hypothesis**. There is evidence to suggest that the average battery life is significantly different from 150 hours.

#### **2. Two-Sample Z-test Solution:**
- Null hypothesis: $H_0$: There is no significant difference between the average incomes of the two regions.
- Alternative hypothesis: $H_1$: There is a significant difference between the average incomes of the two regions.
- $Z = \frac{60000 - 65000}{\sqrt{\frac{160

00000}{n_1} + \frac{25000000}{n_2}}} = \frac{-5000}{\sqrt{\frac{16000000}{n_1} + \frac{25000000}{n_2}}}$
  (Assuming $n_1 = n_2 = 30$ for the sake of simplicity)
  - $Z = \frac{-5000}{\sqrt{\frac{16000000}{30} + \frac{25000000}{30}}} = \frac{-5000}{\sqrt{533333.33 + 833333.33}} = \frac{-5000}{\sqrt{1366666.67}} \approx \frac{-5000}{1167.38} \approx -4.28$
- Critical Z-value for $ \alpha = 0.05$ (two-tailed) is approximately ±1.96.
- Since $-4.28 < -1.96$, **reject the null hypothesis**. There is evidence to suggest that the average incomes of the two regions are significantly different.

### **Chi-Square Tests: A Detailed Tutorial**

---

#### **What is a Chi-Square Test?**
The **Chi-Square test** is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant association between categorical variables. It assesses how expectations compare to actual observed data. There are two main types of Chi-Square tests:

1. **Chi-Square Test for Independence**: Used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables in a contingency table.
2. **Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test**: Used to determine if a sample distribution fits a population distribution.

---

### **1. Chi-Square Test for Independence**

#### **When to Use**
This test is used when you want to see if there is a significant relationship between two categorical variables. For example, you might want to examine if gender (male/female) is related to voting preference (Democrat/Republican).

#### **Hypotheses**
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: The two categorical variables are independent (no association).
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$**: The two categorical variables are not independent (there is an association).

#### **Formula**
The Chi-Square statistic is calculated using the formula:
$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E}
$$
Where:
- $O$ = observed frequency
- $E$ = expected frequency, calculated as:
$$
E = \frac{(\text{row total}) \times (\text{column total})}{\text{grand total}}
$$

#### **Steps to Perform a Chi-Square Test for Independence**
1. **Create a Contingency Table**: Collect the data and summarize it in a contingency table.
2. **Calculate Expected Frequencies**: Use the formula provided above.
3. **Compute the Chi-Square Statistic**: Plug the observed and expected frequencies into the Chi-Square formula.
4. **Determine Degrees of Freedom**: 
   $$
   df = (r - 1)(c - 1)
   $$
   Where $r$ is the number of rows and $c$ is the number of columns in the table.
5. **Compare to Critical Value**: Use a Chi-Square distribution table to find the critical value for your significance level (e.g., 0.05).
6. **Make a Decision**: If the calculated $\chi^2$ is greater than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis.

---

### **2. Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test**

#### **When to Use**
This test is used when you want to see if a sample distribution fits a known or hypothesized population distribution. For example, you might want to test if a six-sided die is fair.

#### **Hypotheses**
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: The sample distribution fits the population distribution.
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$**: The sample distribution does not fit the population distribution.

#### **Formula**
The formula for the goodness-of-fit test is the same as for the test of independence:
$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E}
$$
Where:
- $O$ = observed frequency
- $E$ = expected frequency

#### **Steps to Perform a Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test**
1. **Determine Expected Frequencies**: Based on the hypothesized distribution.
2. **Compute the Chi-Square Statistic**: Use the formula provided.
3. **Determine Degrees of Freedom**: 
   $$
   df = k - 1
   $$
   Where $k$ is the number of categories.
4. **Compare to Critical Value**: Use a Chi-Square distribution table to find the critical value for your significance level.
5. **Make a Decision**: If the calculated $\chi^2$ is greater than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis.

### **Hands-On Example: Chi-Square Test for Independence**

Suppose we want to examine if there is a relationship between gender and preference for a type of snack (Chips vs. Candy). The data collected is as follows:

|             | Chips | Candy | Total |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Male        | 30    | 10    | 40    |
| Female      | 20    | 20    | 40    |
| **Total**   | 50    | 30    | 80    |

#### **Step 1: Calculate Expected Frequencies**
- For males preferring chips:
$$
E = \frac{40 \times 50}{80} = 25
$$
- For males preferring candy:
$$
E = \frac{40 \times 30}{80} = 15
$$
- For females preferring chips:
$$
E = \frac{40 \times 50}{80} = 25
$$
- For females preferring candy:
$$
E = \frac{40 \times 30}{80} = 15
$$

|             | Chips (O) | Chips (E) | Candy (O) | Candy (E) |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Male        | 30        | 25        | 10        | 15        |
| Female      | 20        | 25        | 20        | 15        |

#### **Step 2: Compute Chi-Square Statistic**
$$
\chi^2 = \frac{(30 - 25)^2}{25} + \frac{(10 - 15)^2}{15} + \frac{(20 - 25)^2}{25} + \frac{(20 - 15)^2}{15}
$$
$$
\chi^2 = \frac{25}{25} + \frac{25}{15} + \frac{25}{25} + \frac{25}{15} = 1 + 1.67 + 1 + 1.67 = 5.34
$$

#### **Step 3: Determine Degrees of Freedom**
$$
df = (2 - 1)(2 - 1) = 1
$$

#### **Step 4: Critical Value**
At $\alpha = 0.05$ and $df = 1$, the critical value from the Chi-Square distribution table is approximately 3.841.

#### **Step 5: Decision**
Since $5.34 > 3.841$, we **reject the null hypothesis**. There is evidence to suggest that there is a relationship between gender and snack preference.

|---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| High School   | 25      | 20      | 15      | 20      |
| College       | 20      | 25      | 30      | 25      |

2. **Compute Chi-Square Statistic**:
$$
\chi^2 = \frac{(25 - 20)^2}{20} + \frac{(15 - 20)^2}{20} + \frac{(20 - 25)^2}{25} + \frac{(30 - 25)^2}{25}
$$
$$
\chi^2 = \frac{25}{20} + \frac{25}{20} + \frac{25}{25} + \frac{25}{25

} = 1.25 + 1.25 + 1 + 1 = 4.5
$$

3. **Determine Degrees of Freedom**:
$$
df = (2 - 1)(2 - 1) = 1
$$

4. **Critical Value**:
At $\alpha = 0.05$ and $df = 1$, the critical value is approximately 3.841.

5. **Decision**:
Since $4.5 > 3.841$, we **reject the null hypothesis**. There is evidence to suggest that education level and type of transportation are related.

---

#### **Solution for Exercise 2: Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test**
1. **Calculate Expected Frequencies**:
   - Expected for each face (fair die): $E = \frac{60}{6} = 10$

| Face | Observed (O) | Expected (E) |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| 1    | 10           | 10            |
| 2    | 12           | 10            |
| 3    | 8            | 10            |
| 4    | 11           | 10            |
| 5    | 9            | 10            |
| 6    | 10           | 10            |

2. **Compute Chi-Square Statistic**:
$$
\chi^2 = \frac{(10 - 10)^2}{10} + \frac{(12 - 10)^2}{10} + \frac{(8 - 10)^2}{10} + \frac{(11 - 10)^2}{10} + \frac{(9 - 10)^2}{10} + \frac{(10 - 10)^2}{10}
$$
$$
\chi^2 = 0 + \frac{4}{10} + \frac{4}{10} + \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{10} + 0 = 0.4 + 0.4 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 1.0
$$

3. **Determine Degrees of Freedom**:
$$
df = k - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
$$

4. **Critical Value**:
At $\alpha = 0.05$ and $df = 5$, the critical value is approximately 11.070.

5. **Decision**:
Since $1.0 < 11.070$, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**. There is not enough evidence to suggest that the die is not fair.

### **A/B Testing: A Detailed Tutorial**

---

#### **What is A/B Testing?**
**A/B Testing**, also known as split testing, is a method used to compare two versions of a webpage, app, or any other marketing element to determine which one performs better in terms of user engagement or conversion rates. 

- **Importance in Decision-Making**: A/B testing provides data-driven insights that help businesses make informed decisions. By testing variations, organizations can optimize their strategies and increase their overall effectiveness, ensuring that their resources are allocated to the most successful options.

---

### **1. Introduction to A/B Testing**

#### **Definition**
A/B Testing involves dividing a sample group into two (or more) groups:
- **Group A** (Control): This group experiences the current version (or control).
- **Group B** (Treatment): This group experiences a new version (or treatment).

#### **Applications**
- Website design changes
- Marketing campaign variations
- Product features
- Pricing strategies

---

### **2. Setting Up A/B Tests**

#### **Step 1: Hypothesis Formulation**
Before conducting an A/B test, it's crucial to formulate a clear hypothesis. A hypothesis is a testable statement that predicts the expected outcome of the A/B test.

**Example**: "Changing the color of the call-to-action button from blue to green will increase the click-through rate by 10%."

#### **Step 2: Identify Control and Treatment Groups**
- **Control Group**: The segment of users who interact with the original version.
- **Treatment Group**: The segment of users who interact with the modified version.

Ensure that the sample size is large enough to yield statistically significant results.

#### **Step 3: Randomization**
Randomly assign users to either the control or treatment group to eliminate biases and ensure the results are representative.

---

### **3. Analyzing Results**

#### **Data Collection**
Collect data on key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to your hypothesis. Common metrics include:
- Conversion rates
- Click-through rates
- Revenue per visitor

#### **Statistical Analysis**
After gathering data, perform statistical tests to determine if there is a significant difference between the control and treatment groups. The choice between a **t-test** or a **z-test** depends on the sample size and whether the population standard deviation is known.

- **T-Test**: Used when the sample size is small (typically n < 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown.
- **Z-Test**: Used when the sample size is large (n ≥ 30) and the population standard deviation is known.

**Hypothesis Testing Steps**:
1. Define null and alternative hypotheses.
   - **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: There is no difference between the control and treatment groups.
   - **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)**: There is a difference between the control and treatment groups.
   
2. Choose a significance level ($\alpha$), commonly set at 0.05.

3. Calculate the test statistic (t or z) using the appropriate formula:
   - **T-Test**:
   $$
   t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}
   $$
   where $s_p$ is the pooled standard deviation.

   - **Z-Test**:
   $$
   z = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sigma \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}
   $$
   where $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.

4. Compare the test statistic to the critical value from the t or z distribution table based on the chosen significance level and degrees of freedom.

5. Make a decision: Reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on the comparison.

---

### **4. Hands-On Example: Mock A/B Test**

**Scenario**: A company wants to determine whether changing the headline of a landing page affects the conversion rate.

- **Hypothesis**: "Changing the headline from 'Buy Now' to 'Get Yours Today!' will increase the conversion rate by at least 15%."

- **Sample Size**: 2000 visitors (1000 for the control group and 1000 for the treatment group).

#### **Data Collection**:
- **Control Group (Buy Now)**: 120 conversions out of 1000 visitors.
- **Treatment Group (Get Yours Today!)**: 150 conversions out of 1000 visitors.

#### **Calculate Conversion Rates**:
- Control Group Conversion Rate:
$$
CR_1 = \frac{120}{1000} = 0.12\%
$$
- Treatment Group Conversion Rate:
$$
CR_2 = \frac{150}{1000} = 0.15\%
$$

#### **Statistical Analysis**:
1. **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: $CR_1 = CR_2$
2. **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)**: $CR_1 \neq CR_2$

3. **Calculate the test statistic (Z-Test)**:
- Pooled Conversion Rate ($CR_p$):
$$
CR_p = \frac{120 + 150}{1000 + 1000} = \frac{270}{2000} = 0.135
$$

- Calculate the standard error:
$$
SE = \sqrt{CR_p(1 - CR_p) \left(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}\right)} = \sqrt{0.135(1 - 0.135) \left(\frac{1}{1000} + \frac{1}{1000}\right)} \approx 0.022
$$

- Z-Score:
$$
z = \frac{CR_2 - CR_1}{SE} = \frac{0.15 - 0.12}{0.022} \approx 1.36
$$

4. **Critical Value**: At $\alpha = 0.05$ (two-tailed), the critical z-values are approximately ±1.96.

5. **Decision**: Since $1.36 < 1.96$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that changing the headline significantly impacts the conversion rate.

---

### **Assessment Exercise: A/B Testing**

#### **Exercise 1: Hypothesis Testing in A/B Testing**
A website runs an A/B test on two different versions of a product page. The following data is collected:

- **Control Group (Version A)**: 300 conversions out of 1500 visitors.
- **Treatment Group (Version B)**: 350 conversions out of 1500 visitors.

1. Formulate a hypothesis for the A/B test.
2. Calculate the conversion rates for both groups.
3. Use a z-test to analyze the results. State the null and alternative hypotheses, calculate the z-score, and make a decision.

#### **Exercise 2: Mock A/B Test**
A mobile app tests two different user onboarding processes:

- **Control Group**: 200 users with the original onboarding (40 completed the onboarding).
- **Treatment Group**: 200 users with a new onboarding process (60 completed the onboarding).

1. Calculate the conversion rates for both groups.
2. Perform a hypothesis test using a z-test. Include the hypothesis statements, calculations, and decision-making process.

---

### **Assessment Solutions**

#### **Solution for Exercise 1**
1. **Hypotheses**:
   - $H_0$: There is no difference in conversion rates between Version A and Version B.
   - $H_1$: There is a difference in conversion rates between Version A and Version B.

2. **Calculate Conversion Rates**:
   - Control Group Conversion Rate:
   $$
   CR_A = \frac{300}{1500} = 0.20\%
   $$
   - Treatment Group Conversion Rate:
   $$
   CR_B = \frac{350}{1500} = 0.2333\%
   $$

3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Pooled Conversion Rate:
   $$
   CR_p = \frac{300 + 350}{1500 + 1500} = \frac{650}{3000} \approx 0.2167
   $$

   - Standard Error:
   $$
   SE = \sqrt{CR_p(1 - CR_p) \left(\frac{1}{1500} + \frac{1}{1500}\right)} \approx \sqrt{0.2167(1 - 0.2167)\left(\frac{2}{1500}\right)} \approx 0.0202
   $$

   - Z-Score:
   $$
   z = \frac{0.2333 - 0.20}{0.0202} \approx 1.64
   $$

   - **Critical Value**: For $\alpha = 0.05$, the critical z-values are ±1.96.

   - **Decision**: Since $1.64 < 1.96$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to suggest that the two versions of the product page have different conversion rates.

---

#### **Solution for Exercise 2**
1. **Calculate Conversion Rates**:
   - Control Group Conversion Rate:
   $$
   CR_C = \frac{40}{200} = 0.20\%
   $$
   - Treatment Group Conversion Rate:
   $$
   CR_D = \frac{60}{200} = 0.30\%
   $$

2. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Pooled Conversion Rate:
   $$
   CR_p = \frac{40 + 60}{200 + 200} = \frac{100}{400} = 0.25
   $$

   - Standard Error:
   $$
   SE = \sqrt{CR_p(1 - CR_p) \left(\frac{1}{200} + \frac{1}{200}\right)} \approx \sqrt{0.25(1 - 0.25)\left(\frac{2}{200}\right)} \approx 0.0354
   $$

   - Z-Score:
   $$
   z = \frac{0.30 - 0.20}{0.0354} \approx 2.83
   $$

   - **Critical Value**: For $\alpha = 0.05$, the critical z-values are ±1.96.

   - **Decision**: Since $2.83 > 1.96$, we reject the null hypothesis. There is evidence to suggest that the new onboarding process significantly increases completion rates.
